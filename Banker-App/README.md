This is a basic project with a landing page and allows user to login or sign up, with this app you can transfer fake money that's hard coded to other users, you can also request for a loan with takes two seconds to get approved and you can close your account there's really nothing so special about it I just wanted to learn new skills I learn in React.js like useState and some other basics, the app also has smooth scrolling
